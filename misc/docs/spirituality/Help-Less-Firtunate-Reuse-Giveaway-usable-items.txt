Donate anything usable, that you're not using! Help someone and the planet by promoting reuse.

Date: Saturday 10 July 2021
Time: between 12 noon and 2 pm
Location: Gate 4 (Exit gate)

10 Carton boxes will be kept near Gate 4 (Exit gate) by 12pm on Saturday, where we have kept the bins for E-waste collection. 

You can get your own cartons/ packets or use the ones that are there. Tata ace can accommodate about 20 regular size cartons.

Details:
A few of us are sponsoring a Tata ace mini truck, this Saturday, to transport cartons and packs of any items you don't want but can be reused by someone else. Could be usable footwear, clothes, notebooks with at least 25+ unused sheets, textbooks and fiction; for all ages as the volunteers give in hands of people of all ages; electronics, working or in need of some repair: phones, tabs that can be used by less fortunate students; Utensils, mattresses, and cushions. Any item that is usable but you don't need and we can fit in Tata ace!

The Tata ace will take it to a volunteer's house in Jayanagar. There, others will check, sort, and distribute to the needy in the next 4-6 weeks. We will get photos.

Please message via telegram https://t.me/tgkBlr5 or tap to WhatsApp https://wa.me/919663930605  so we can have an approximate count of cartons and packets. Request you to pack in a carton and seal it or wrap it in some newspaper and put it in a carry bag/ shopping bag so does not get dirty on the way. Footwear also please wrap and then put in a carton or separate packet/ shoebox.

If you can volunteer to help supervise loading the items. please reach out. Looking for one person who will be free from 2 to 2:45 pm
